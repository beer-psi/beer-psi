## about me
I'm beerpsi (he/they), a programmer and rhythm game enthusiast.

I can work with various programming languages, but my preferred ones are C#, TypeScript, Rust,
and especially Python, my primary language of choice for most personal projects.

Outside of programming, I like to listen to music, read manga and play RPGs.

I am also currently looking for a job. If you find me suitable, please [contact over email](#contacts).
